      <p>Including this  poem...</p>
      <p><b>Word To The Mothers</b></p>
      <p><i>Never underestimate the power of a praying mother/
For her words connect to God and dope addicts recover/
Through the arson of prayer her enemies are scattered/
Though her clothes are tattered/
A potter's vessel; her enemies are shattered/
When they gathered/
Like Long John's shrimp they're battered-

Dipped in the sea of the forgotten/
Withered like the fig tree in Mark their fruit is rotten/

She sends up praise/
In the latter days/
Seeking the face of God with a heavenly gaze/
Sweet like a dozen glazed/
She's not fazed/

Though the weapons form
God's will she performs/
Trusting in His will, to His word she conforms/
Through the renewing of her mind she is transformed/
Now her garments are adorned (Selah)//

The Lord has used her prayers to save and set free many/
Through her works in the kitchen bellies are filled with plenty/
She has exhorted many-

Many whom were face down to the ground/
Lost sheep she's found/
Because she is a queen, The Lord Yeshua (Jesus) shall bring her a crown/

        To my mother, and all the good mothers! Happy mothers day. </i></p>
